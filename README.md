## 📖 Pedagogical Foundation
This tool is strictly aligned with the course's primary reference:
> **Nilsson, James William, and Susan A. Riedel.** *Electric Circuits.* Global edition. Harlow, England: Pearson.

### Key Topics Covered:
* **Component Physics (Ch. 6):** Real-world behavior of Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors.
* **Time Domain Analysis (Ch. 7-8):** First and second-order differential equations (RC, RL, RLC).
* **Laplace Theory (Ch. 12):** Transformation pairs, properties, and inverse transforms.
* **s-Domain Analysis (Ch. 13):** Transfer functions $H(s)$, pole-zero mapping, and frequency response.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Interactive Solvers:** Manipulate component values ($R, L, C$) and see real-time updates to time-domain plots and s-plane pole locations.
- **AI Teaching Assistant:** A Socratic TA is available in the sidebar to guide you through difficult derivations and offer study tips for the exam.
- **Mathematical Rigor:** All formulas and notations match the Nilsson & Riedel textbook exactly.
